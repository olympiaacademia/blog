Quantum Supremacy Using a Programmable Superconducting Processor

Physicists have been talking about the power of quantum computing for over 30 years, but the questions have always been: will it ever do something useful? For such large-scale endeavors it is good engineering practice to formulate decisive short-term goals that demonstrate whether the designs are going in the right direction.
